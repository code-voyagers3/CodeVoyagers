# Peer Evaluation
The peer evaluation covers a method for group evaluation, that  is our way to make the grade for a group work more fair because it is rarely the case that all the group members have contributed exactly the same amount of work to the project using peer evaluation and self evaluation.

## How it works
- After a group project students evaluate the contribution of all members of the group
- Each member in the group evaluates each member of the group (including themselves)
	- We end up with n² replies if n is the number of students in the group (in our case 9)
	- We use a formula for calculating the grade (see example slide)
	- Students that get more than average from the evaluation will get a final grade that is higher than the grade they got for the project
	- lower average will as well result in a grade lower than the project grade

- Teacher grade counts 50% towards the Peer/Self evaluation grade
So if we think the grades are unfair we can correct hem
- It is important to introduce this system before the project starts so that students know that they need to contribute to the group work to get a good grade
- Students need to write some text to each grade and give a reason for their grades

## Example:
In our school we use a scale from 0 to 10 and students get 7*n points (where n is the number of students in the group) to distribute among themselves (so the average will always be 7)

They get this rubric to help them:

Grade | Remarks | Explanation 
-- | -- | -- 
10 | Exceptional |  This student needed to take full responsibility for the project
9 | Really good | This student owns most parts of the project
8 | Very good | This students took on more than the average of the work
7 | Good | This student did the same amount of work as others in the group
6 | Acceptable | This student could have been more active in the group work
5 | Okay | This student took on little responsibility
4 | Lacking something | This student did not meet the groups standards for work
3 | Unacceptable | This students work participation was unacceptable but he did some work
2 | Inactive | This student hardly participated in the group work
1 | Nothing | This student did not do any part of the work
0 | Invisible | This student did no work and was not seen during the group work

Let’s say a project gets grated as 7:

- Student A gets 10 on average from peer evaluation (meaning that everyone agreed that he took full responsibility for the project)
His final grade is then 7*1.3 = 9.4

- Student B worked as expected, nothing more, nothing less and got an average of 7 from peers
His final grade is then 7*1=7 (same as project)

- Student C was marked in their group but never showed up and gets 0 from everyone (including himself because he knows)
His final grade is then 7*0.3 = 2.1

## Adjustments and final words
We can of course create our own scale and change the phrases.

However we do it, the outcome will always be that students get less frustrated if some group members are not as active because they know that if they take on the extra responsibility it will show on their grade.
