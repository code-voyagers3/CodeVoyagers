# Thoughts on next year’s project

## Online week and icebreaking
The online week with group division, design sprint and icebreaking activities has been crucial to the project and we should continue with this structure.

## Spanish introduction
The physical icebreaker with the Spanish student’s selection of attractions and following group visits to these, was ideal to the relations in the groups. They should have more time to do this and instead we should have less focus on the following presentation.

## Common workflow methods
Teachers should be on the same level in workflow methods (Design Sprint, Git)
We can apply Erasmus+ for a KA-102 project where we can meet up and develop further didactics and pedagogical outcomes in autumn 23. A case could be next year's project where we work together like we want the students to.

## One hotel
To encourage relations between the visiting students, they should stay at the same hotel if possible.

## Common schedule
The project should have a common day-by-day schedule for all weeks.

## Spanish weekend activity
The barbecue in San José del Alamo was suggested and planned by spanish students and that carried out a high participation of spanish students. We should continue this strategy for the weekend activity.

## Project submissions
A formular to submit project references
We could use a google formular where the students can submit the different URL references that they use in the project:

- Link to figma/design sprint
- Link to frontend application
- Link to backend application
- Link to git repositories
- Link to presentation
