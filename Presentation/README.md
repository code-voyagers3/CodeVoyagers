## Overall plan:
Each group gets 15 minutes for the presentation. The format can be a powerpoint and oral. 
Every presentation should be live streamed and recorded on video.

The program could be like:

- 08:30: Group [GROUPNAME]
- 08:45: 5 minutes break
- 08:50: Group [GROUPNAME]
- 09:05: 5 minutes break


Each presentation should be uploaded so it can be opened from the same computer. Then we can increase the amount of connection problems.

## Evaluation
Teachers and industry professionals can evaluate each presentation through a Google formular.

Immediately feedback is given by industry professionals if any.

Afterwards teachers will meet online to evaluate each project.

Finally teachers will meet online with each group to grade their work.
