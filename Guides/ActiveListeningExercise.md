# Active Listening Exercise

**Presumptions**: Students are in a breakout room on Zoom meeting with their group members (in groups of 4 students).

**Duration**: 80 minutes

**Activity**:



1. Students decide the initial roles for each member of the group by choosing:
    - One Talker
    - One Writer/Secretary
    - The other two are Active listeners

2.  The group starts the active listening:
    - Talker talks about these topics:
        1. Tells about themselves
            - What is your name and age?
            - Where are you from?
            - What is your background in Web development?
            - What kind of projects have you done before? 
            - Do you have some other skills that could benefit the group? 
        2. Tells about their expectations to the projects 
            - What would you like to eat in the evenings?
            - Where would you like to go after school? 
            - Do you know any good places in Las Palmas?
            - What would you like to focus on in the project (design? coding? something else?) 
            -  What do you think you will be able to accomplish during this project? 
    - Writers writes down the main points that the talker talks about
    - Listener(s):
        1. Listen carefully
        2. Say things like “aha…” “mmmhmmm…” etc. to keep the talker talking
        3. Write down questions whenever you can think of a question
        4. If the talker stops talking ask some of the questions that you have in your list or think of other questions to ask

3. After 20 minutes you change the roles and start again from step 2. If your group has only 3 members you can change after 30 minutes.

4. When everyone has been a talker and a writer the exercise is over and everyone should have a better idea of who they are working with and what their expectations are. You can then share the document with your group through your communication channel.
