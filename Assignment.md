# The Sustainable Island 2024
 
A digital, Erasmus+ funded collaboration between WEB-Developer students from I.E.S. El Rincon, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Tækniskolinn, Reykjavik, Iceland and  TECHCOLLEGE, Aalborg, Denmark.

## Project Description
To build a web application that aligns with the sustainable UN World Goals. 

The task is to define an actual problem statement and in a collaboration build a web application that can contribute to solve this  problem. The problem should be defined through different interviews during the first days of the design sprint and the solution must have an sustainable approach that meets the requirements of the UN World Goals.

In the first days of the design sprint you will talk to people to find out exactly how big of a problem this is or if there is actually some other problem that might be more important to solve also take into account the sustainable approach and meet .

> Jacub: Create a web application showcasing a selection of solutions that demonstrate a commitment to sustainability and support the United Nations' Global Goals.
Teams have the autonomy to determine their own content, design, and method of presentation.
The compilation could be themed around specific categories such as eateries, beaches, or musical performances or a mix of various elements.

> Smari: The group should start with finding a problem that they want to solve called a problem statement. In the first days of the design sprint you will talk to people to find out exactly how big of a problem this is or if there is actually some other problem that might be more important to solve also take into account the sustainable approach and meet the requirements of the UN World Goals.
